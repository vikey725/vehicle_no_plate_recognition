# vehicle no plate recognition using Pretrained VGG Model

The model includes a pretrained VGG19 as feature_extractor => dense(relu) => bi-lstms => dense(softmax) and [CTC loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-connectionist-temporal-classification-3797e43a86c) layer.


# Data and Some outputs of the model
The dataset has cropped RGB image liscence plate and the vehicle_no as output. the dataset.csv file has info related to data. Some of the outputs of the model is given below:
